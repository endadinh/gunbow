As a result, the project's value diminishes over time. To tackle this issue, the game's token has created a single token system rather than the two tokens (main token and reward token) used by other projects. The NFTs, not the token, is the fundamental element in this project that stores the project's value. The game's economy centers around NFTs, and NFTs will be the location where value is kept. It can be said that NFTs are the soul of the project.",

In SQF, token is not the main element that stores a project’s value but rather NFT.  Economy of the game revolves around NFT and NFT will be the place where the value is stored. It can be said that  NFT is the soul of the project."

People called these games Gameblockchain (game+blockchain), or GameFi (game+finance), because playing games could make money. However, accessing these titles was too new and risky. We don't have the confidence to pursue it yet.",
